# Final-Project
-Go to dotabuff.com and search any player name
-A list of player names will appear
-Click on the player you want to enter into the program
-In the url, there will be a url that looks like this:

https://www.dotabuff.com/players/(PLAYER ID HERE)

-(PLAYER ID HERE) is what you want to paste into the first box of the program

-Here are some player IDs that I used for testing:
151912302
126287545
119215182
183078297

-However, any player ID from the website will work with the program
